CS3750:ADV TOPICS IN MACHINE LEARNING (replaced by ISSP 3535, effective January 1, 2018):This course will survey advanced topics in machine learning, for example, inductive learning, reinforcement learning, and neural network learning.
CS3790:ADVANCED TOPICS IN EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY: PERSONALIZED LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS:The 2010 National Educational Technology Plan outlined how "The challenge for our education system is to leverage the learning sciences and modern technology to create engaging, relevant, and personalized learning experiences for all learners." While instruction has traditionally been one-size-fits-all, the rise of web-based and mobile technologies provide an opportunity to automatically detect what learners need and adapt instruction to their unique prior knowledge, motivation, and preferences. In this seminar course, we survey different types of personalization in educational technologies (e.g., cognitive, metacognitive, social, motivational), computational modeling techniques for representing learners and their needs, and best practices in designing personalized supports for learners. Students will lead one or more class discussions, participate in the other discussions, and complete a group course project.   Students must have a foundational knowledge of algorithms and data structures before enrolling in this course.
CS3800:ADVANCED TOPICS IN COMPUTING:This course aims to provide students with an introduction to a range of advanced topics in computing. It will explore the current and future challenges facing the emerging computing paradigms. These will also be used to illustrate the many different influences and trade-offs involved in computing and information systems.
CS3900:PHD DIRECTED STUDY:The course may involve a project under the supervision of a faculty member.
