Globally, we see conversations about open data in research, with growing expectations and requirements to share research data, and in government, with policies and initiatives to expand public access to datasets. This course will focus onThis second category of open data: data produced and shared by government and civic organizations. This course will overview the historical precedents to the open data movement, survey current policies at different levels of government, and examine key concepts in the open data movement. While we will focus on drivers and initiatives in the United States, we will look at case studies that will provide us with a broader understanding of what is happening worldwide.

LIS2222:ARCHIVAL APPRAISAL, DESCRIPTION, AND ACCESS:This course is organized in three parts and will provide students with an introduction to the critical archival responsibilities of archival appraisal, description, and access. In the first section of the course, we will engage with archival appraisal. The archivistâs process in determining continuing value affects all other archival functions and impacts individual, organizational, and societal memory. Because of its significance for both archival work and society, appraisal has been the function most debated and subjected to experiments with new methodologies and theoretical models. This course will survey these models and, through an experiential project, delve deeply into one model in particular: documentation strategy. 1 Representing archival materials and providing access to them are core functions of the archival profession. Archivists do this with access systems that incorporate descriptive standards, data structures, controlled vocabularies, and increasingly, digital tools. The ways in which archives are described and represented influence the ways that users, such as historians, lawyers, and policymakers access, engage with, and understand the historical record. In the second section of this course, students will engage with archival descriptive standard and archival management systems, as well as debates and theories in the representation of information. Finally, weâll consider strategies for raising the level of access for an archival collection, paying particular attention to the creation of digital exhibits.
